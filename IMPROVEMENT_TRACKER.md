## üö´ REJECTED SUGGESTIONS

### Items NOT being implemented (with reasoning):

1. **"Consistently achieved" instead of "typically achieved"**
   - Reason: Legal risk. "Typically" is safer and still credible with dual disclaimers.
   - Status: ‚ùå Rejected

2. **Emoji mini-badges on Services page (üîß üí∏ üì°)**
   - Reason: Could look unprofessional for enterprise buyers. Using lucide-react icons instead.
   - Status: ‚ùå Rejected (using icons instead)

3. **Fourth metric "6 weeks ‚Üí Time to full cost visibility"**
   - Reason: Already present in home page trust strip. Redundant.
   - Status: ‚ùå Rejected

4. **Change "You can't optimise what you can't see"**
   - Reason: Current version is punchier and more memorable (FinOps truism).
   - Status: ‚úÖ Keep current

- All changes maintain UK spelling (realised, optimisation, etc.)
- All changes preserve existing compliance/legal language
- SEO changes are CRITICAL for organic traffic
- Dual CTA pattern proven to increase conversions 12-18%
- Waiting for full audit before bulk implementation
